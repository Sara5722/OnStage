ONSTAGE - PROJECT README Where creatives find their cast and crew.

OVERVIEW OnStage is a professional networking and discovery platform designed to disrupt traditional, gatekept casting. By focusing on creative alignment over superficial metrics, OnStage empowers screenwriters, directors, actors, and producers to connect based on talent, vision, and shared passion.

CORE FEATURES

BLIND MATCHING Our flagship feature allows users to swipe through potential collaborators with a focus on substance over style. -- Talent-First Toggle: Users can hide profile images to browse based solely on descriptions, credits, and vision statements.

FLICKS A high-energy, vertical video feed dedicated to visual portfolios. -- Catch the Vibe: Actors can post monologues, Cinematographers can post lighting tests, and Directors can post clips of their best work. -- Discovery in Motion: Designed to grab attention quickly, allowing for a more dynamic discovery experience than a static resume.
