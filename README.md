# OnStage

> A creative-first discovery and networking platform for film and media professionals.

---

## Overview

**OnStage** is a professional networking and discovery platform designed to disrupt traditional, gatekept casting and hiring in the entertainment industry.

Instead of prioritizing resumes, representation, or connections, OnStage focuses on **creative alignment, vision, and talent**. It empowers screenwriters, directors, actors, and producers to connect based on shared passion and artistic direction.

Creative talent should not be buried.  
**We hear you. We get you. OnStage connects creators through talent, vision, and creative alignment.**

---

## Mission

The entertainment industry often rewards who you know over what you can do. Many talented creatives remain unseen because discovery is tied to networks and gatekeepers.

**OnStage flips discovery into collaboration.**

We believe:
- Creative alignment > connections  
- Vision > vanity metrics  
- Talent deserves visibility  

---

## Inspiration

We were inspired by how many creatives struggle to break into film and media:
- Great scripts go unread  
- Actors get typecast  
- Directors rely on closed networks  

We asked:  
**What if discovery worked more like collaboration and less like networking?**

OnStage was born from the idea that **creative alignment should matter more than connections.**
